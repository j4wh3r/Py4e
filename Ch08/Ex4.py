# in alphabetical order, that are stored in a file romeo.txt containing a
# subset of Shakespeareâ€™s work.
# To get started, download a copy of the file www.py4e.com/code3/romeo.txt.
# Create a list of unique words, which will contain the final result. Write
# a program to open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line
