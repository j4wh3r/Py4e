Exercise 1: What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?
    c)Store information for the long term, even beyond a power cycle

Exercise 2: What is a program?
    A specific set of ordered operations for a computer to perform.

Exercise 3: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
    -A compiler: translate a program written in a high-level language into a low-level
                language all at once, in preparation for later execution.
    -An interpreter: To execute a program in a high-level language by translating it one line
                    at a time

Exercise 4: Which of the following contains “machine code”?
    a) The Python interpreter

Exercice 5:
    >>> primt 'Hello world!' it should be >>> print 'Hello world!'

Exercise 6: Where in the computer is a variable such as “x” stored after
the following Python line finishes?
x = 123
    b) Main Memory

Exercise 7: What will the following program print out:
x = 43
x = x + 1
print(x)
    b) 44

Exercise 8: Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability: (1) Central processing unit, (2) Main Memory, (3)
Secondary Memory, (4) Input Device, and (5) Output Device. For example, “What is the human equivalent to a Central Processing Unit”?
    (1) Central processing unit: is like the humans brain
    (2) Main Memory: a memory that cannot store informations permanetly
    (3) Secondary Memory: compared to the fourth layer of our brain , its like a hard drive that sotres informations permanetly
    (4) Input Device: keyboard,mouse...in humans are ears,nose,eyes...
    (5) Output Device: monitors,speakers... the human output device is the statement or answers that arise over what we feel, see...

Exercise 9: How do you fix a “Syntax Error”?
    we can fix Syntax error after executing the program , because it shows us where the errors are
